<h2>Shell scripts to ease management of the xtclang PaaS</h2>
[link to MR build script for xvm/platform/examples]

* paasstart.sh - prompts for a new admin password (if run for the first time) for the PaaS or the existing password to enable the PaaS
* paasstop.sh - issues a graceful server shutdown to a running instance of the PaaS
* paasclear.sh - clears down PaaS and resets configuration
* passrebuild.sh - rebuilds the PaaS ready for a 'paasstart.sh'
